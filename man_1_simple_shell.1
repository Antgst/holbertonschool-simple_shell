.SH NAME

hsh \- a minimal UNIX command line interpreter (Holberton Simple Shell)

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.PP
.BR "echo " \&"command" " | ./hsh"
.PP
.BR "cat " file " | ./hsh"

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a minimal UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from standard input
and executes them using
.BR fork (2)
and
.BR execve (2).
.PP
In interactive mode,
.B hsh
displays the prompt:
.BR "($) "
then waits for a command line, executes it, and repeats until EOF or the
.B exit
built-in is used.
.PP
In non-interactive mode,
.B hsh
reads commands from standard input (one command per line) and executes each line.
This mode is typically used with pipes or redirected input.
.PP
This project is intentionally limited and focuses on:
.IP \[bu] 2
basic command execution
.IP \[bu]
PATH resolution for commands without
.B /
.IP \[bu]
minimal built-ins (see below)
.PP
It does not implement advanced shell features such as pipes, separators,
redirections, quoting, history, aliases, or job control.

.SH BUILTINS
The following built-ins are implemented:
.TP
.B env
Prints the current environment, one variable per line, to standard output.
.TP
.B exit
Exits the shell. The process exits with the status of the last executed command.
No argument handling is implemented.

.SH PATH RESOLUTION
When executing a command:
.IP \[bu] 2
If the command name contains a slash
.RB ( / ),
.B hsh
does not search
.BR PATH ;
it attempts to execute the command exactly as provided.
.IP \[bu]
If the command does not contain a slash,
.B hsh
searches each directory listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable and executes the first match found.
.IP \[bu]
Empty entries in
.B PATH
(e.g. leading, trailing, or consecutive colons such as
.BR "::" )
are treated as the current directory
.RB ( "." ).

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell process exits with the status of the last executed command, similar to
.BR sh (1).
.PP
Typical exit statuses returned for a command execution are:
.TP
.B 0
Success (command executed and returned 0).
.TP
.B 126
Command found but not executable (permission denied, or a directory).
.TP
.B 127
Command not found.
.PP
If a child process is terminated by a signal,
.B hsh
returns:
.BR 128 + signal_number .

.SH ERROR FORMAT
On errors, messages are printed to standard error using a format similar to
.BR sh (1):
.PP
.nf
<shell_name>: <line_number>: <command>: not found
.fi
.PP
Where:
.IP \[bu] 2
.I shell_name
is the program name (argv[0])
.IP \[bu]
.I line_number
is the current input line number (notably relevant in non-interactive mode)

.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
Interactive mode:
.PP
.nf
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
($) env
USER=...
PATH=...
($) exit
$
.fi
.PP
Non-interactive mode:
.PP
.nf
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
$ echo "qwerty" | ./hsh
./hsh: 1: qwerty: not found
$ echo $?
127
.fi

.SH NOTES
This shell is an educational project developed for the Holberton curriculum.
It is not intended to be a complete POSIX shell and only guarantees the behavior
documented in this manual page.
